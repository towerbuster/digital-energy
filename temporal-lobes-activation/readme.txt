The temporal lobes are theorized to be involved in spiritual phenomena. Particularly, the right temporal lobe in the spiritual experience itself and the left temporal lobe in the recollection of the event afterwards. (Attempts to stimulate the temporal lobe to induce spiritual phenomena have been made with devices such as the "God Helmet.")

This file stimulates the temporal lobes.
