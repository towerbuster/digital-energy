The temporal lobes are theorized to be involved in spiritual phenomena. Particularly, the right temporal lobe in the spiritual experience itself and the left temporal lobe in the recollection of the event afterwards. (Attempts to stimulate the temporal lobe to induce spiritual phenomena have been made with devices such as the "God Helmet.") Participants of the CIA-investigated "Gateway Program" at the Monroe Institute showed a trend of increasing temporal activity upon completion of the program, as their psychic abilities were increasing. The effect was particularly prevalent in females, but in both genders to a great extent.

This file stimulates the temporal lobes, particularly the right. It will increase the brainwave frequency in the temporal lobes (to Gamma and higher). It's unisex.
